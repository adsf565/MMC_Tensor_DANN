# Tensor-Based Adversarial Transfer Learning for MMC Fault Diagnosis

## Project Overview
This repository is associated with the research on fault diagnosis of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) in modern smart grids. The work proposes a Tensor-Based Adversarial Transfer Learning Framework to address the challenges of diagnostic precision degradation caused by high-dimensional fault space and data distribution shifts (e.g., capacitor aging) in MMC lifecycle operation. 

Key contributions of this study include:
- Modeling MMC monitoring signals as 3rd-order tensors to preserve spatiotemporal structural correlations
- Integrating Tensor Tucker Decomposition for disentangled physical feature extraction
- Introducing Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks to bridge the "reality gap" from component degradation
- Achieving 8.1% improvement in global diagnostic accuracy and 15 ms fault localization under degradation conditions

## Code Release Plan
The complete source code (including data preprocessing, tensor decomposition, model training/inference, and evaluation scripts) will be publicly released in this repository upon the official publication of the associated research paper

We will ensure the code is well-documented, reproducible to facilitate further research and engineering applications in MMC fault diagnosis.
